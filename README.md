# Program Control Number to TOP Code Crosswalk using COCI

The code takes the Chancellor's Office Curriculum Inventory ([COCI](https://coci2.ccctechcenter.org/programs)) data and creates a program control number (PCN) to Taxonomy of Programs (TOP) crosswalk to identify student majors of study by TOP code. Since colleges can submit either a program control number or TOP code to COCI to identify a students' program of study, this crosswalk is used to turn all MIS major elements into common TOP codes.
